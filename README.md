Python 3 – used for the back-end logic and Flask server.

2. Back-End Framework

Flask – lightweight Python web framework to build the API and server.

flask-cors – handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) so the front-end can communicate with the API.

3. Front-End

HTML – structures the web page (index.html).

CSS – styles the page, including layout, colors, and buttons.

Bootstrap 5 – CSS framework for responsive design, buttons, forms, and grid layouts.

JavaScript – handles user input, sends requests to the Flask API, and updates GPA results dynamically.
